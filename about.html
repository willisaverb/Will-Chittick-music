   <div class="content"> <p class="body-corporate">Will Chittick is a solo singer songwriter from Port Kembla, NSW.  After fronting surf-psyche band the Chitticks, he began developing new material, honing his skills busking on the streets of the NSW south coast.  Drawing on his affection for artists such as Billy Bragg, the Dirty Three, Johnny Cash and Kirin J Callinan, his songs are characterised by multi-tambrel harmonic arrangements that speak to folk oriented singer/songwriter traditions, with emphasis on natural guitar tones and lyrics with deeply personal yet often playful narratives. His song Hollow Day (released by Le Boogie Records) has been played over 7000+ times on Soundcloud and he has supported the likes of Steve Smyth, Jepp and Depp and Ben Wright Smith as well as regularly performing at the Port Kembla Street Festival.</p></div>
