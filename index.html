   <div class="content"> <p class="body-corporate">Will Chittick is a solo singer songwriter from Port Kembla, NSW.  Previously fronting surf-psyche band the Chitticks, hebegan developing some of the material he had been working on in his spare time and found an unlikely affection for the country influences of artists such as Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash and the Rolling Stones. His songhs are characterised by simple yet beautiful harmonic arrangements that speak to folk oriented singer/songwriter traditions, with emphasis on natural guitar tones and lyrics with deeply personal yet often playful narratives. His song Hollow Day (released by Le Boogie Records) has been played over 7000+ times on Soundcloud and he has supported the likes of Steve Smyth, Jepp and Depp and Ben Wright Smith.</p></div>
